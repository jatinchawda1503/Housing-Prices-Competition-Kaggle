# Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users
 
- This competition is tailored for those familiar with R, Python, and fundamental machine learning concepts. 
- The goal of this competition is to predict sales price of homes in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset that comprises 79 variables detailing almost every facet of the residential properties. 
- The data emphasizes that factors beyond mere aesthetics play a significant role in pricing. The competition serves as a practical ground to hone skills such as creative feature engineering and the application of advanced regression techniques, including random forest and gradient boosting. The dataset in use, known as the Ames Housing dataset, was curated by Dean De Cock and is seen as an updated alternative to the Boston Housing dataset. 

## Evaluation

- The evaluation metric is the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted and observed sales prices, ensuring that prediction errors for both low and high-priced homes are equally impactful.
